    <h1>Trance music</h1>
    <p><b>Trance</b> is a genre of electronic dance music that developed in the 1990s. It is usually characterized by a tempo of between 125 and 150 beats per minute.</p>
        <p>Classic trance usually employs a "four-to-the-floor" time signature, a tempo of 125 to 150 BPM, 32 beat phrases, and is somewhat faster than house music. A kick drum is usually placed on every downbeat and a regular open hi-hat is often placed on the upbeat or every 1/8th division of the bar.Extra percussive elements are usually added, and major transitions, builds or climaxes are often foreshadowed by lengthy "snare rolls"â€”a quick succession of snare drum hits that build in velocity, frequency, and volume towards the end of a measure or phrase.
A Simple arpeggiated (Roland JP-8000) Supersaw waveform pattern with chorus and flanging.
A trancegate pattern at 141 bpm as it is heard on a software trancegate. The gated pattern gradually changes, to hear the various rhythms possible with a trance gate. Note that some trancegate patterns are off-beat. (A Roland JP-8000 with the supersaw waveform is used. Minor EQ edits are made).
Rapid arpeggios and minor scales are common features. Trance tracks often use one central "hook," or melody which runs through almost the entire song, repeating at intervals anywhere between 2 beats and several bars, in addition to harmonies and motifs in different timbres from the central melody.</p>
